        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step by Step</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
                <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
                <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
                <li>After you finish cooking the patties, seal the bread for 2 minutes on the grill.</li>
                <li>When the bread is sealed, put the bottom part on a table, and build your burger as you wish.</li>
                <li>The last step is just putting the top piece of the bread, crowning your king!</li>
        </ol>
